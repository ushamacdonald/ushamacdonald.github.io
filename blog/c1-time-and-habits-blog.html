      I tried out the headspace app a little while ago and found it really helpful. There's way less distractions
      and mind drifting so it's a lot easier to keep your attention on one thing. It also seems to help stress levels
      from getting out of control.

      The 7 counterintuitive way to be production was pretty interesting to me. Procrastination is something that I
      find can be a bit of an issue but it does seem to come about when I'm not fully understanding what I'm doing
      or it's becoming too mechanical. That particular point of timeboxing and the Pomodoro technique where you break
      bigger tasks into blocks makes it a lot easier to manage and seems to change that kind of behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'd like to keep trying both of these techniques to keep improving my work habits!
