    <h2>HTML CSS & DOM</h2>
      <p>To me it's like writing a song. You have the melody of the song, the chord progressions and so on
        which is your HTML. You then have the different aspects you add to the song to make it sound better
        and make it it's own individual song such as the lyrics and harmonies as well as the different
        instruments involved. This is like your CSS. And finally you have the structure of the song, the
        order of verse, chorus, bridge etc and this is the DOM. The HTML creats the different parts of the
        page while the CSS styles it and then the DOM inteprets the document and structures it.<p>
    <h2>What is meant by boxifying design?</h2>
      <p>This is when you divide the page into boxes for all the elements there.<p>
    <h2>What is the box model?</h2>
      <p>The box model is what makes up each "box" of an element. This is broken down into the margins,
        borders, padding and content of the element.<p>
