    <h2>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h2>
      <p>
          It seems like working on your emotional intelligence is a great way to optimize yourself and
          work to a higher standard. Better work performance, leadership and greater happiness are things
          I think most people work towards and to be able to train your brain into providing that is a
          powerful thing.
        <p>
    <h2>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h2>
      <p>
          While it is a easy thing to do I thought it was really interesting to notice just how often
          my attention did wander in such a short amount of time. Makes you realise how often it must
          happen throughout the day without us even realising.
