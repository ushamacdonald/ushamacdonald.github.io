I feel like the DBC/EDA experience takes a pretty unique approach in the way that it's so hands on. The focus
really seems to be on creating the right environment for success rather than just the right content. In the
orientation it mentions that EDA does more than create web developers, but also develops people. It's the
more personal aspect that really drew me to the course in the first place.

In the past I've found when I've done training in web development (which included a fair amount of self
study) that while it's amazing what you can learn, it is so easy to get caught down that rabbit hole. Having
the support of both the EDA staff and everyone else in the cohort experiencing the same as you seems like it's
going to be so beneficial to the whole experience. I loved the analogy Shereef gave of us walking from San Fran to Seattle and while some may be a few steps
ahead, its nothing compared to the rest of the journey in front of us.

To be surrounded by people who are motivated and aiming for the same thing I am definitely excites me, and I
look forward to bootcamp when we can continue to work together to get where we want to be.
